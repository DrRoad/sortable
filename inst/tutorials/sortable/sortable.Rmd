# Sorting LETTERS

Sort the answers from A to E:


```{r letters}
question_sortable(
  "Sort the first 5 letters",
  answer(LETTERS[1:5], correct = TRUE),
  answer(rev(LETTERS[1:5]), correct = FALSE, "Other direction!"),
  random_answer_order = TRUE,
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  options = list(
    animation = 150
  )
)
```

###### Try E to A as well!
