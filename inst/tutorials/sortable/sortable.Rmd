# Sorting LETTERS

Sort the answers from A to E:


```{r letters}
question(
  "Sort the first 5 letters",
  answer(LETTERS[1:5], correct = TRUE),
  answer(rev(LETTERS[1:5]), correct = FALSE, "Other direction!"),
  type = "sortable",
  random_answer_order = TRUE,
  allow_retry = TRUE
) %>%
  modifyList(
    list(
      options = list(
        animation = 150
      )
    )
  )
```

###### Try E to A as well!
